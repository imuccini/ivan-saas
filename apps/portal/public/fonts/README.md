# Fonts

Place self-hosted font files here for walled garden compliance.

## Required Files

Download Inter font from https://rsms.me/inter/ and add:

- Inter-Regular.woff2
- Inter-Medium.woff2
- Inter-SemiBold.woff2
- Inter-Bold.woff2

## Why Self-Hosted?

Captive portals run in a "walled garden" where the only accessible domain is our portal. External resources (like Google Fonts CDN) are blocked by the network controller.
