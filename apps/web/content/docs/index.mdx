## Core Concepts

Understand the fundamentals:

### Network Access Control

Cloud NAC provides centralized control over who and what can access your network. It combines authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement in a single cloud-based platform.

### AI-Powered Automation

Our platform uses artificial intelligence to:

- Automatically profile and classify devices
- Detect anomalies and security threats
- Recommend policy optimizations
- Adapt to changing network conditions

### Zero Trust Architecture

Cloud NAC implements zero trust principles:

- Verify every device and user
- Grant least-privilege access
- Continuously monitor and validate
- Assume breach and limit blast radius

## Key Features

### Guest WiFi Management

Deliver seamless guest experiences with automated onboarding, customizable portals, and compliance reporting.

### BYOD Security

Enable employees to use personal devices safely with automatic profiling, network segmentation, and threat detection.

### IoT Protection

Secure thousands of IoT devices with automatic discovery, micro-segmentation, and behavioral analysis.
