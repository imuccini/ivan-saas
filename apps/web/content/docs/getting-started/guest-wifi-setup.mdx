# Guest WiFi Setup

This guide walks you through setting up guest WiFi access with cloud NAC.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Cloud NAC account with admin access
- Network infrastructure configured
- SSID created for guest access

## Step 1: Create Guest Network Policy

Navigate to **Policies** → **Guest Access** and create a new policy:

```json
{
  "name": "Guest WiFi",
  "accessType": "guest",
  "duration": "24h",
  "bandwidth": "10Mbps",
  "isolation": true
}
```

### Policy Settings

- **Access Duration**: How long guests can stay connected (1h, 8h, 24h, 7d)
- **Bandwidth Limit**: Maximum speed per device
- **Client Isolation**: Prevent guests from seeing each other
- **Internet Only**: Block access to internal resources

## Step 2: Configure Captive Portal

Customize the guest onboarding experience:

### Portal Branding

Upload your logo and customize colors:

- **Logo**: 200x60px PNG or SVG
- **Primary Color**: Brand color for buttons and links
- **Background**: Solid color or image

### Authentication Methods

Choose how guests authenticate:

- **Email**: Guests enter email address
- **SMS**: Receive code via text message
- **Social Login**: Sign in with Google, Facebook, etc.
- **Voucher**: Use pre-generated access codes
- **Sponsor**: Require employee approval

## Step 3: Set Up Compliance

Configure data collection and retention:

### Required Fields

Collect information for compliance:

- Full name
- Email address
- Phone number (optional)
- Company name (optional)
- Terms acceptance

### Data Retention

Set how long to keep guest records:

- **30 days**: Minimum for most regulations
- **90 days**: Recommended for business use
- **1 year**: For high-security environments

## Step 4: Test Guest Access

Before going live, test the complete flow:

1. Connect to guest SSID
2. Verify captive portal appears
3. Complete authentication
4. Confirm internet access
5. Check isolation (can't reach internal resources)

## Step 5: Monitor and Optimize

After deployment, monitor guest activity:

### Key Metrics

- **Active Sessions**: Current connected guests
- **Daily Users**: Unique guests per day
- **Average Duration**: How long guests stay connected
- **Bandwidth Usage**: Total data transferred

### Common Adjustments

- Increase/decrease session duration
- Adjust bandwidth limits
- Add/remove authentication methods
- Update portal branding

## Advanced Features

### Custom Terms and Conditions

Upload your own T&C document:

```markdown
# Terms of Service

By accessing this network, you agree to:

1. Use the network for lawful purposes only
2. Not attempt to access restricted resources
3. Accept monitoring of network activity
```

### Scheduled Access

Limit guest WiFi to business hours:

- **Monday-Friday**: 8 AM - 6 PM
- **Saturday**: 9 AM - 5 PM
- **Sunday**: Disabled

### Location-Based Policies

Apply different policies by location:

- **Lobby**: 1-hour access, social login
- **Conference Rooms**: 8-hour access, email verification
- **Outdoor**: 30-minute access, no authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Portal Not Appearing

If guests don't see the captive portal:

1. Check DNS settings (should redirect to portal)
2. Verify DHCP is providing correct gateway
3. Test with different devices/browsers
4. Check firewall rules

### Authentication Failing

If guests can't authenticate:

1. Verify email/SMS service is configured
2. Check for typos in email addresses
3. Test with known-good credentials
4. Review authentication logs

### No Internet Access

If guests can authenticate but can't browse:

1. Verify NAT is configured
2. Check firewall allows outbound traffic
3. Test DNS resolution
4. Review bandwidth limits
