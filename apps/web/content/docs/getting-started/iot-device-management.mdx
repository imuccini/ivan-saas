# IoT Device Management

Secure thousands of IoT devices without manual configuration using cloud NAC's automated discovery and micro-segmentation.

## Overview

IoT device management includes:

1. Automatic device discovery
2. Device profiling and classification
3. Micro-segmentation policies
4. Behavioral monitoring

## Step 1: Enable IoT Discovery

Activate automatic IoT device detection:

### Discovery Methods

Cloud NAC discovers IoT devices through:

- **Passive monitoring**: Analyze network traffic
- **Active scanning**: Probe for devices (optional)
- **DHCP analysis**: Identify from DHCP requests
- **mDNS/SSDP**: Discover via service announcements

### Discovery Configuration

```json
{
  "discovery": {
    "passive": true,
    "active": false,
    "protocols": ["dhcp", "mdns", "ssdp", "upnp"],
    "scanInterval": "1h"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Device Profiling

AI automatically classifies discovered devices:

### Device Categories

- **Cameras**: IP cameras, webcams
- **Sensors**: Temperature, motion, environmental
- **Building Automation**: HVAC, lighting, access control
- **Printers**: Network printers, MFPs
- **Smart Devices**: TVs, displays, appliances
- **Medical**: Patient monitors, imaging equipment
- **Industrial**: PLCs, SCADA, manufacturing equipment

### Profiling Attributes

For each device, cloud NAC identifies:

- **Type**: Camera, sensor, printer, etc.
- **Manufacturer**: Vendor name
- **Model**: Specific model number
- **Firmware**: Version information
- **Protocols**: Communication methods used
- **Risk Level**: Security assessment

## Step 3: Create Micro-Segments

Isolate IoT devices in dedicated segments:

### Segmentation Strategy

Group devices by:

- **Function**: Cameras, sensors, printers
- **Location**: Building, floor, room
- **Risk**: High-risk (internet-facing) vs. low-risk
- **Vendor**: Separate untrusted vendors

### Example Segments

**IP Cameras Segment**:
- Inbound: Management station only
- Outbound: NVR/VMS server only
- Inter-segment: Blocked

**Building Sensors Segment**:
- Inbound: BMS controller only
- Outbound: BMS controller only
- Inter-segment: Blocked

**Printers Segment**:
- Inbound: Print server, user devices
- Outbound: Internet (for updates)
- Inter-segment: Blocked

## Step 4: Define Access Policies

Set granular rules for each segment:

### Policy Components

- **Source**: Who/what can initiate connections
- **Destination**: What the device can connect to
- **Protocols**: Allowed protocols and ports
- **Schedule**: Time-based restrictions
- **Actions**: Allow, block, alert

### Example Policy

```json
{
  "segment": "ip-cameras",
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "Allow NVR Access",
      "source": "ip-cameras",
      "destination": "nvr.company.local",
      "protocol": "rtsp",
      "port": 554,
      "action": "allow"
    },
    {
      "name": "Allow Management",
      "source": "admin.company.local",
      "destination": "ip-cameras",
      "protocol": "https",
      "port": 443,
      "action": "allow"
    },
    {
      "name": "Block Everything Else",
      "source": "any",
      "destination": "ip-cameras",
      "protocol": "any",
      "action": "block"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 5: Enable Behavioral Monitoring

Activate AI-powered anomaly detection:

### Baseline Learning

AI establishes normal behavior for each device:

- Typical communication patterns
- Expected data volumes
- Regular connection times
- Known destinations

Learning period: 7-14 days

### Anomaly Detection

AI flags deviations from baseline:

- **Unusual Destinations**: Device connecting to new servers
- **Abnormal Traffic**: Excessive data transfer
- **Timing Anomalies**: Activity at unusual hours
- **Protocol Violations**: Unexpected communication methods

### Automated Response

When anomalies detected:

1. **Generate Alert**: Notify security team
2. **Increase Monitoring**: Capture detailed logs
3. **Quarantine (optional)**: Isolate suspicious device
4. **Block Traffic**: Prevent malicious connections

## Device Inventory

Maintain comprehensive IoT inventory:

### Inventory Data

For each device, track:

- Device type and manufacturer
- IP and MAC addresses
- Network segment
- First/last seen timestamps
- Firmware version
- Security posture
- Anomaly history

### Export Options

Export inventory as:

- CSV for spreadsheets
- JSON for automation
- PDF for reports

## Monitoring Dashboard

View real-time IoT security status:

### Key Metrics

- **Total Devices**: All discovered IoT devices
- **By Category**: Breakdown by device type
- **By Risk Level**: High, medium, low risk devices
- **Active Alerts**: Current security issues
- **Policy Violations**: Blocked connection attempts

### Visualizations

- Device map by location
- Traffic flow diagrams
- Anomaly timeline
- Top talkers

## Common IoT Scenarios

### Scenario 1: IP Camera Deployment

**Requirements**:
- 50 IP cameras across facility
- Cameras must send video to NVR
- Management from admin workstation only
- No internet access

**Solution**:
1. Create "IP Cameras" segment
2. Allow outbound to NVR only
3. Allow inbound from admin workstation
4. Block all other traffic
5. Enable anomaly detection

### Scenario 2: Building Automation

**Requirements**:
- HVAC, lighting, access control
- Devices communicate with BMS
- No cross-device communication
- Internet for cloud updates

**Solution**:
1. Create segment per system type
2. Allow communication with BMS only
3. Block inter-device traffic
4. Allow internet on schedule (e.g., 2 AM daily)
5. Monitor for unusual patterns

### Scenario 3: Guest Printers

**Requirements**:
- Printers in lobby for guest use
- Guests can print from guest WiFi
- Isolated from corporate network
- Internet for driver downloads

**Solution**:
1. Create "Guest Printers" segment
2. Allow inbound from guest WiFi
3. Allow outbound to internet
4. Block corporate network access
5. Monitor print jobs

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Discovery

Before implementing policies:

- Run discovery for 1-2 weeks
- Review all discovered devices
- Verify device classifications
- Document device purposes

### 2. Implement Gradually

Don't segment everything at once:

- Start with high-risk devices
- Test policies thoroughly
- Monitor for issues
- Expand incrementally

### 3. Document Everything

Maintain clear documentation:

- Segment definitions
- Policy justifications
- Device inventories
- Change history

### 4. Regular Audits

Quarterly review:

- New devices discovered
- Orphaned devices (no longer active)
- Policy effectiveness
- Anomaly patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Discovered

If IoT device not appearing:

- **Check network connectivity**: Verify device is online
- **Review discovery settings**: Ensure appropriate methods enabled
- **Wait for scan**: Discovery runs periodically
- **Manual add**: Add device manually if needed

### Device Can't Communicate

If device can't reach required destination:

- **Review policy**: Check segment rules
- **Verify destination**: Confirm target is correct
- **Check firewall**: Ensure no blocking rules
- **Test connectivity**: Use ping/traceroute

### False Positive Alerts

If getting too many anomaly alerts:

- **Extend baseline**: Allow longer learning period
- **Adjust sensitivity**: Reduce alert threshold
- **Whitelist behavior**: Mark known-good patterns
- **Review device**: Investigate if device compromised
